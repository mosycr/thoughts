## LLM providers should be regulated like telecom

A huge amount of VC and global attention is focussed on building large language models and companies like OpenAI are all the rage. 

There is a feeling that these companies will usher in a new economic revolution. I buy that.

But I do not feel that they will able to capture all the value that is being attributed to their valuations. They are building all models on top of publically available information - A public good.

Pretty soon, I expect these organizations will be regulated.They sane way I foresee this happening is similar to the way telecom companies are regulated. They will have to pay a licence fee for operating an llm over the knowleghebase of humankind. And they will provide a commoditized service.
