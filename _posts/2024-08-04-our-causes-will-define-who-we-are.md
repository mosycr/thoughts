## What we care about will define who we are

We might be the first generation in history where the majority of people will identify more with their causes than their work. Thanks to AI

Historically, economic activity has concentrated on filling gaps in the market - typically areas where there is deficiency in some offering. Entrepreneurs identify sections and areas where needs are not being satisfied, double down on solving for that and make their money.

Whereas there will always be such pockets and money will always be made in fulfilling these requirements, bulk of the money in the future will be made on figuring out how to add economic value in an economy where resources are plentiful and not scarce.

Capitalism has proved to be the winning system for allocation of scarce resources. Will it continue to be as impactful when resources are not the primary constraint?

If the basic needs of the society are already met, where will the focus of the society move to? And what will the key constraints be on that journey?

I would imagine causes would become important. They would mould our self-expression, identity, sense of community and our actions.
