_Hi, I'm Mayank._ <br />

My journey in the tech industry spans nearly two decades, with a significant part dedicated to bootstrapping my own ventures. From high tech to healthcare IT, e-commerce, and influencer-led commerce, my experience covers a broad spectrum of sectors, each offering its unique set of challenges and learnings.

Currently, I lead technology at [The Ayurveda Experience](https://www.theayurvedaexperience.com), a Skincare D2C company, where we leverage cutting-edge technology to drive efficiencies accross the supply chain, improve customer experience and enhance traditional skincare wisdom.

As we stand on the brink of a new era with AI transforming every aspect of our lives, I am especially excited about the advancements we are making in this field. I'm keen to invest in AI-first projects that resonate with my belief in technology's power to solve complex problems and improve lives.

### Looking Forward

I believe that the intersection of AI and traditional sectors holds untapped potential for world beating solutions. My goal is to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs, technologists, and innovators eager to explore this frontier. If you are working on an AI-first project, I would love to hear from you.

Let's embark on this journey together, harnessing the power of AI to create groundbreaking solutions.
